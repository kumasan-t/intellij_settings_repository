# WeatherCraft
an educational Minecraft project.

## What is WeatherCraft?
Weathercraft is an Arduino Weather Station that communicates with Minecraft 
in order to recreate real weather conditions 
into Minecraft for educational purposes.

Our goal is to educate young people to adopt 
good energy habits
by let them play Minecraft 
with real life weather conditions and climate changes in game based on their good/bad energy behaviour.
